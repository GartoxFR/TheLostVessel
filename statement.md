Artist statement
================

I've always been fascinated about video games. I played a lot of them
and I'm still playing today when I find the time. Video games pushed 
me to learn computer science which became my passion, and later the center
of my education. 

Making games remained a dream for me because each time I tried, I got 
scared of the amount of work it was taking, especially the art part of
it. I just knew how to program and it was not enough to build games.
You need good graphics, good gameplay ideas, good musics and so on.
All of the fields I wasn't so good at.

This project gave me the chance to try again with a more defined goal
and some obligations. I had recently played a game called Outer Wilds which 
I really admired. The idea is that you are a new astronaut on a small planet.
However some strange things happens in the solar system so you need to figure out
what is going on. The catch is that you are not powerful at all in this 
dangerous universe. The game constantly reminds you how fragile you are 
for example when you run out of oxygen, when you collide with a planet and die 
and so on...This triggered a strong feeling of wonder in me. You can't do
much except contemplating the universe, exploring ancient ruins from an ancient
civilization and read their writings.

I wanted to recreate this kind of feeling so I chose to develop a game which
takes place in space. The plot is that you wakeup in an alien spaceship that
was recently discovered in orbit around your planet. You don't know anything 
about it and need to start looking for clues to understand the story. Your only
company is an AI that tries to help you analyze the situation. You don't even 
know if you will be able to exit the ship as you had to traverse a big forcefield
to enter. 

I didn't finalize more of the plot and it's something I need to deepen in the future 
as the game development progresses. 

With the story in mind, I next needed to decide on the visual style of the game.
As I'm not very good at drawing I chose a simple top down pixel art style inspired
by the famous game Undertale. I learned some basis on pixel, chose a color pallet
and started drawing the floor, walls, a simple door, some decoration objects and the
player sprite. My main idea was to make the ship environment look futuristic but 
abandoned. I settled on pretty cold colors with a bright blue to represent 
the energy the vessel use. For clarity reason when playing, the main character is
made using brighter color so we can always see him well on screen.

In the meantime, I developed a new system to be able to bring up a dialog window
on the screen when I needed to, so that the AI can give the player instructions
at the beginning of the game. After writing some basic dialog, I got a very small working 
prototype that I am very happy with.
